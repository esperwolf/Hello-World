<h># Hello-World
Getting to know GitHub.</h>

<p>I am a self taught programmer. I learned most of my programming by editing Proboards forums and a place called Alison. I have a strong desire to create visual works of art. I am very bad at drawing with my own two hands however. So I create my art with the art of coding and photomanipulation.</p>
<p>My desire to create stemmed from a young age full of imagination. Because of it I create many things. I am advent Roleplayer, spriter, Logo Designer, coder and artist. Most of my work can be seen on a digimon roleplaying site called Digi-force and Digimon World Affairs.</p>
<p>I do not have to get paid to enjoy coding. While easily frustrated I am also easily motivated to figure out why something doesn't work. Because in the end I want to create what I imagined. That is what I am here to do. Create and learn from other creators. I hope this place will become like a second home to me.</p>
